                        A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There
                        are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect
                        shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape
                        and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.

                        Tulips (Tulipa) form a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes (having bulbs as storage
                        organs). The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually
                        in warm colors). They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals,
                        collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of
                        cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial.

                        Dianthus caryophyllus, commonly known as the carnation or clove pink, is a species of Dianthus. It is probably
                        native to the Mediterranean region but its exact range is unknown due to extensive cultivation for the last 2,000
                        years. Carnations require well-drained, neutral to slightly alkaline soil, and full sun. Numerous cultivars have
                        been selected for garden planting. Typical examples include 'Gina Porto', 'Helen', 'Laced Romeo', and 'Red Rocket'.
                        They are used for medical purposes, such as for upset stomach and fever. Their fragrance was historically used for
                        vinegar, beer, wine, sauces and salads.

                        Narcissus is a genus of predominantly spring flowering perennial plants of the amaryllis family, Amaryllidaceae.
                        Various common names including daffodil, narcissus and jonquil are used to describe all or some members of the
                        genus. Narcissus has conspicuous flowers with six petal-like tepals surmounted by a cup- or trumpet-shaped corona.
                        The flowers are generally white and yellow (also orange or pink in garden varieties), with either uniform or
                        contrasting coloured tepals and corona.
